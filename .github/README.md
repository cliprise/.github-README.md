# Cliprise

Cliprise is a multi-model AI experimentation platform focused on image and video generation workflows.

We explore, document, and compare modern generative AI models to help creators and teams iterate faster, reduce tool-switching, and build consistent creative pipelines.

This GitHub organization contains:
- Public workflows and prompt structures
- Model comparison notes (image & video)
- Practical experiments and lessons learned
- Supporting research for the Cliprise platform
